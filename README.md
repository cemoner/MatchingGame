# MatchingGame
In order to open the project you need javafx library and you need to add module path to vm options
It is a game which the program picks 8 cards from a 52 card deck and replace them randomly twice in the screen
And pictures have listeners and when you click them they reveal themselves(2 max at a time) with card flip animation
If the cards match they don't close back but if they are different the cards close again
You can't open 3 cards while the other 2 cards are not compared and animations are done
